                <p>The first choropleth map contains both state and county level election data. The deeper the color is, the bigger the advantage of the party who won the place.</p>
                <p>The second point map contains the county level data. The larger the circle is, the bigger the advantage of the party who won the place. If you click each circle, you can see the result in detail.</p>

                <p>This is a choropleth map showing the economic dependence types of each county in US. If you click each county, you can see their policy-relevant types. The opacity is associated with the number of issues: the more issues it has, the more opaque the color is. </p>

                <p>This point map contains all the natural disasters in China from 1966 to 2018. The larger the circle is, the more disaster happened in that province. If you zoom in, you can see the exact location of each disaster and its year. </p>

                <p>This is a point map showing the start/end station of citibike in New York City in September 2020 and 2021. The size of each circle represents the number of trips starting/ending in that particular station. If you click each point, you can see the station name and the number of trips.</p>

                <img src="img/04-temp.png" alt="Mapping the 40 year temperature change of Monsoon Asia Area">
                <p>This is a gridded map showing the temperature change of Monsoon Asia Area on June 1 from 1975 to 2015. It is a small slice of how global warming is affecting the microclimate in certain area on certain day. For me, it's a brand new trial to explore NetCDF filetype and complicated science dataset.</p>
